# Ice Cream Sales and Shark Attacks
The number of pairwise correlations rapidly increases as numeric variables get added to a dataset.

It’s common in exploratory analysis to plot simple correlations to see how variables move together. 

Warning: be careful presenting simple correlations to business stakeholders.

The untrained eye tends to see a data pattern and wants to infer causality.

See Edward Tufte’s description of the rage-to-conclude bias. 

Just because A and B move together does not prove that A causes B or B causes A. 

To prove causality, in practice, we often rely on counterfactual experiment design.

Give business stakeholders a visual example to act as a rage-to-conclude warning vs. stating  “correlation does not imply causation”.

Use correlations to inspire further investigation and analysis vs. making strong claims right out of the gate.

The above is a typical example from introductory statistics textbooks.
